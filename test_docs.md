# Automated Testing
 When the source code is parsed, the comments are not included in the parsing tree as part of the code, whereas docstrings are included in the parsed code tree.

### Why Automated Testing
- Time (can be automated easly and quickly)
- Accurate cuts out human error)
- Early bug detection when scheduled

Testing operates at different levels. Some tests might apply to a tiny detail (does a particular model method return values as expected?) while others examine the overall operation of the software (does a sequence of user inputs on the site produce the desired result?)
Automated tests is that the testing work is done for you by the system. You create a set of tests once, and then as you make changes to your app, you can check that your code still works as you originally intended, without having to perform time consuming manual testing.

 If something’s gone wrong, tests will also assist in identifying the code that’s causing the unexpected behavior.
